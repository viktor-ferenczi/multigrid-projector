[h1]Client plugin to project and weld blueprints of multiple sub-grids[/h1]
[list]
[*] Build and repair PDCs, mechs and more
[*] Works both in survival and creative
[*] Works both in single player and multiplayer
[/list]

[h2]How to install the client plugin[/h2]
[olist]
[*] Subscribe to this mod
[*] Install the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2407984968]Plugin Loader[/url]
[*] Start the game
[*] Open the Plugins menu (should be in the Main Menu)
[*] Enable the Multigrid Projector plugin
[*] Click on Save, then Restart (below the plugin list)
[/olist]

After enabling the plugin it will be active for all single player worlds you load and in case of multiplayer if the server or the other client you connect to also has the plugin loaded. Do not add the plugin as a mod to the worlds themselves, it is not required and will not load anyway.

[i]Enjoy![/i]

[h2]Server plugins[/h2]
[list]
[*] [url=https://torchapi.net/plugins/item/d9359ba0-9a69-41c3-971d-eb5170adb97e]Torch Server[/url] (updated automatically by Torch)
[*] [url=https://www.ferenczi.eu/se/multigrid-projector/]Dedicated Server[/url] (requires manual updating)
[/list]

[b]If you play on a multiplayer (Dedicated or Torch) server, then both the server plugin (on server side) and the client plugin (on the player's machine) must be installed! Using only the client plugin will not work properly.[/b]
