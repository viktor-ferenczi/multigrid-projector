= Manual Installation without the Plugin Loader =

For some players MGP fails to load with the Plugin Loader.

In this case the only way to use the MGP is to install it directly to Space Engineers:

1. Create an easy to access folder, like C:\MGP

2. Rename Multigrid_Projector.plugin to Multigrid_Projector.dll

   Copy Multigrid_Projector.dll into C:\MGP

   Right click on C:\MGP\Multigrid_Projector.dll and open its Properties.
   If you see an Unblock button anywhere, then click it.

3. Download https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony/releases/download/v2.0.4.0/Harmony.2.0.4.0.zip

   Extract the ZIP, copy the net472/0Harmony.dll file into C:\MGP
   
   Right click on C:\MGP\0Harmony.dll and open its Properties.
   If you see an Unblock button anywhere, then click it.
 
4. Exit from Space Engineers if it is running.

   In Steam right click on Space Engineers, select Properties. 

   In GENERAL scroll down to the LAUNCH OPTIONS
   
   Enter: -skipintro -plugin C:\MGP\Multigrid_Projector.dll
   
   Close the dialog.
 
5. Start Space Engineers, MGP should be available.

   You can test it by trying to load a multigrid blueprint. If it loads the subgrids, then it works.

   Another way is to look into the game's log file for lines with "Multigrid" in them.
 
Enjoy!
