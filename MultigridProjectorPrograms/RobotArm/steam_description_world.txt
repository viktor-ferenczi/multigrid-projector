[h2]Remarks[/h2]
[list]
[*] Tested only in single player in creative mode so far.
[*] Should work in multiplayer with simpler / less number of arms.
[*] The video shows an earlier iteration with more arms. The new code works better with less arms.
[*] The code may be refactored later to improve its usability in different worlds and for other use cases.
[*] Works best with skinny blueprints, primarily small block ones. Solid large block ships are blocking out the arms.
[*] Yes, you can build your own robot arms. The base must be in the "Welder Arms" group. Simpler is better.
