Dedicated Server plugin companion for the [Multigrid Projector](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2415983416) client plugin.

Allows for projecting and welding blueprints of multiple subgrids.

- Build and repair PDCs, mechs and more
- Works both in survival and creative
- Works both in single player and multiplayer

**Add the MultigridProjectorDedicated.dll file as a plugin on the Dedicated Server's Configuration UI.**

**Players who want to take part in multigrid welding must install the client plugin.**

Please see the [workshop page](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2415983416) on how to install the client plugin.

Enjoy!
