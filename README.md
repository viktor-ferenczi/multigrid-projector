# Multigrid Projector

Multigrid Projector for the Space Engineers game.

- Build and repair PDCs, mechs and more
- Works both in survival and creative
- Works both in single player and multiplayer

## Install the client plugin

1. Subscribe to this mod
2. Install [Plugin Loader](https://github.com/sepluginloader/SpaceEngineersLauncher)
3. Start the game
4. Open the Plugins menu (should be in the Main Menu)
5. Enable the Multigrid Projector plugin
6. Click on Save, then Restart (below the plugin list)

After enabling the plugin it will be active for all single player worlds you load.
In case of multiplayer full functionality is supported if the server also has the
MGP plugin installed, but most of the multigrid welding will still work if not.

*Thank you and enjoy!*

## Server plugins

In case of problems join the [SE Mods Discord](https://discord.gg/PYPFPGf3Ca) to get help.

**If you are using a 3rd party game server hosting provider**, then please follow their documentation on how to install the server plugin or contanct their support with your questions.

### Torch server plugin installation

[Torch plugin](https://torchapi.com/plugins/view/?guid=d9359ba0-9a69-41c3-971d-eb5170adb97e) (updated automatically by Torch)

Add the plugin on Torch's UI, then restart the server. Make sure your players are aware of the Plugin Loader, so they can install the client plugin.

### Dedicated Server plugin installation

[Plugin download](https://github.com/viktor-ferenczi/multigrid-projector/releases/) (requires manual updating)

- Open: https://github.com/viktor-ferenczi/multigrid-projector/releases/
- Download and extract the latest release: `MultigridProjectorDedicated-*.zip` 
- Keep `0Harmony.dll` and `MultigridProjectorDedicated.dll` in the same folder.
- Right click on each of the DLLs, select **Unblock** in the **Properties** dialog if you have such a button (Windows protection). 
- Start the Dedicated Server and continue to the configuration.
- Under the Plugins tab add the `MultigridProjectorDedicated.dll` file as a plugin.
- Start your server.

### Special case on Linux (Proton)

Please define the `SE_PLUGIN_DISABLE_METHOD_VERIFICATION` environment variable
to disable IL code verification.

Reason for the IL code verification is to detect potentially breaking code changes 
introduced over game updates. In such a cases the verification blocks the plugin
from loading instead of crashing later.

You can detect this case by looking in the game's log file for this text: 
`Refusing to load the plugin due to potentially incompatible code changes`

## Building from source

The top level plugin projects have dependencies on their respective game files.
The game assemblies (DLLs) are referenced from the directories defined in the
`Directory.Build.props` file. This file is not part of the repository, 
you need to create it yourself from a template:

- Copy: `Directory.Build.template.props` => `Directory.Build.props`
- Edit `Directory.Build.props` to match your local setup

You need to do this only once per working copy. 
You may also want to save this file for later reuse.
